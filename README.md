# FlowersClassification-using-CNN
This project uses convolutional neural networks (CNN) to classify flowers based on images. The dataset used in this project is the Flower Recognition dataset from Kaggle, which contains 4323 images of flowers from 5 different species. The model achieved an accuracy of 96% in classifying flower species.

## Dataset
The Flower Recognition dataset contains 4323 images of flowers from 5 different species: daisy, dandelion, rose, sunflower, and tulip. The images are in JPEG format and have a resolution of 320x240 pixels. The dataset is split into a training set (70%) and a validation set (30%).

## Model
The CNN model used in this project consists of several convolutional layers, pooling layers, and dense layers. The model was trained and evaluated using Python's Keras library.

## Results
The model achieved an accuracy of 93% in classifying flower species on the validation set, which indicates that the model is able to identify most of the flowers correctly.

## Usage
To use this project, clone the repository and run the flower_classification.py script. The script will load the dataset, preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate the model on the validation set, it also provides more detailed information about the model's performance and the project in general.
